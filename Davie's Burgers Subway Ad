--Do you remember Davie’s Burgers from our Learn CSS course? 
--Well, the restaurant business has been booming and it is now looking to place a catchy advertisement in the local subway station.
--Help them dig into their orders table to see if there is anything interesting in there for a funny tagline!
--Start by getting a feel for the orders table:

SELECT *
FROM orders
LIMIT 10;


--How recent is this data?
--Use DISTINCT to find out all the unique order_date values in this table.

SELECT DISTINCT order_date
FROM orders;

--The special_instructions column stores the data where Davie’s Burgers customers leave a note for the kitchen or the delivery.
--Instead of selecting all the columns using *, write a query that selects only the special_instructions column.
--Limit the result to 20 rows.

SELECT special_instructions
FROM orders
LIMIT 20;

--There seem to be a lot of empty values in that column. That is because customers sometimes leave the notes section blank.
--Can you edit the query so that we are only returning the special instructions that are not empty?

SELECT special_instructions
FROM orders
WHERE special_instructions IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 20;

--Let’s go even further and sort the instructions in alphabetical order (A-Z).

SELECT special_instructions
FROM orders
WHERE special_instructions IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY special_instructions
LIMIT 20;

--Let’s search for special instructions that have the word ‘sauce’.

SELECT special_instructions
FROM orders
WHERE special_instructions LIKE '%sauce%';

--Let’s search for special instructions that have the word ‘door’.
SELECT special_instructions
FROM orders
WHERE special_instructions LIKE '%door%';

--Let’s search for special instructions that have the word ‘box’.
SELECT special_instructions
FROM orders
WHERE special_instructions LIKE '%box%';

--Wow, some of these are marketing gold! But what are their order numbers?
--Instead of just returning the special instructions, also return their order ids.
--For more readability: Rename id as ‘#’ and Rename special_instructions as ‘Notes’

SELECT id AS '#', special_instructions AS 'Notes'
FROM orders
WHERE 2 IS NOT NULL;

-- Challenge
-- They have asked you to query the customer who made the phrase. 
-- Return the item_name restaurant_id, and user_id for the person created the phrase.

SELECT item_name, restaurant_id, user_id
FROM orders
WHERE special_instructions = 'Draw a narwhal on the delivery box.';
