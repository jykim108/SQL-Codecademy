--Reputable Product Agency (RPA) has started receiving complaints from their credit card processor about fraudulent transactions. 
--Help your finance department identify potentially risky transactions before they finish processing.
--This dataset contains a single table, transaction_data.

--What are the column names?
SELECT *
FROM transaction_data
LIMIT 10;

--Find the full_names and emails of the transactions listing 20252 as the zip code.
SELECT full_name, email, zip
FROM transaction_data
WHERE zip = '20252';

--Finance has also noticed a number of pseudonyms associated with fraudulent transactions.
--The fraudsters thought it would be funny to use ‘Art Vandelay’ for their full name or add a ‘der’ for their middle name.
--Use a query to find the names and emails associated with these transactions.
SELECT full_name, email
FROM transaction_data
WHERE full_name = 'Art Vandelay' OR full_name LIKE '% der %';

--There are some irregularities in the IP addresses where transactions are originating from. For example, any IP address beginning with ‘10.’ is reserved for internal use. 
--We shouldn’t see IP addresses like this accessing Reputable Company’s service.
--Find the ip_addresses and emails listed with these transactions. Find the ip_addresses and emails listed with these transactions.
SELECT ip_address, email
FROM transaction_data
WHERE ip_address LIKE '10.%';

--Users are making fraudulent transactions using a temporary email address service. 
--These services provide a short-lived email that can be verified and then self-destructs.
--Find the emails in transaction_data with ‘temp_email.com’ as a domain.
SELECT id, email
FROM transaction_data
WHERE email LIKE '%temp_email.com';


--The finance department is looking for a specific transaction. 
--They know that the transaction occurred from an ip address starting with ‘120.’ and their full name starts with ‘John’.
--Can you find the transaction?
SELECT full_name, ip_address
FROM transaction_data
WHERE full_name LIKE "John%" AND ip_address LIKE '120.%';
